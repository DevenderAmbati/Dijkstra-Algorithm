# Dijkstra-Algorithm

The project aimed to create a visual learning tool for understanding Dijkstra's algorithm in the context of pathfinding within a gridded environment with obstacles.

Built using ReactJS and CSS, the project established a dynamic grid where Dijkstra's algorithm could systematically find the shortest route. Real-time visualization, user-friendly interactions, and path retracing were key development features.

The dynamic grid adapts to user input, enabling varied scenarios. Real-time visualization enhances understanding, and user interactions allow grid modifications. The final path is highlighted, providing a clear visual representation of the optimal route. This project serves as an educational and interactive tool for learning about pathfinding algorithms.
